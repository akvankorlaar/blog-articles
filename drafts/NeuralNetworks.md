# Basic Classification with Neural Networks part 1

This is a tutorial on how to write a basic
classification using a Neural Network from scratch.
I've been meaning to do this for a long time, because
writing something down makes me understand something better,
and because I love explaining stuff!

I will try to give as much practical examples as I can, 
both using math and code examples. I hope you have fun learning!

## Input Data

The most important thing when working with Neural Networks
is not the architecture, not the amount of layers, 
or the amount of weights: Its the data. Why? You can
build the largest and most complex network you want,
one rule always stays the same: Bad input = Bad output.
So at the data we start! 

For this example I created a fictitious dataset
that is located at: 


First we take a look at the data to see what we have:
