This blog is part of an introductory series on deep learning.
Check [here](https://arentvankorlaar.nl/post/Deep%20Learning%20Introduction%201) for part 1, and here[https://arentvankorlaar.nl/post/Deep%20Learning%20Introduction%202]( for part 2).

In this third part will be about how backpropagation works. Ill try to give as much particial examples as I can. Hope you have fun learning!
