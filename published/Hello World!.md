Hi, and welcome. After creating many half-finished projects last year,
I thought it would be a good idea to finally finish a project for once. So, here
it is, my first 'finished' project in a while.

So why this website? Because it's fun to make stuff, and it's fun
to share knowledge with other people on the way.

## About this website

The application for this blog has largely been written by Iltar and Yannick.
You can find information about this [here](https://stovepipe.systems/post/bloginception),
and you can find the code on Github [here](https://github.com/yannickl88/blog).
I've created this website by forking their code,
and making some adjustments for my own needs.

## About me
My name is Arent, and I currently live in Holland where I've been a software
engineer for the last couple of years. My current interests include
AI, science fiction, programming, music theory, and guitar playing.
Although my original plan was to keep this blog reserved for technical topics, I may
 publish some blogs on music or on books I've read in the future. 
Thanks, and have fun reading!
