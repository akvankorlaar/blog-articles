Hello, my name is Arent van Korlaar. This website is a place where I want to share some of my love for music, but also want to place some free learning material on topics in Artificial Intelligence. To me both are an important source of inspiration in my life, so I love writing about them. 

The picture in the backdrop is a photo I shot of one of my favorite places in Holland, in the dunes of Zoutelande.

If you are interested in setting up a blog like this yourself, check out https://github.com/yannickl88/blog. 
I've basically forked this repository, and adapted some of its code for my own purposes.
